        <h2>About the Harmonium</h2>
        <p>The harmonium is a free-reed keyboard instrument that produces sound by sending air through reeds that vibrate when wind is pumped using bellows, similar to an organ.<br>
        It gained popularity in India in the late 19th century and became an integral part of Indian music, especially devotional styles.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Features and Construction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reeds:</strong> Thin metal strips (free reeds) that vibrate to produce sound.</li>
            <li><strong>Bellows:</strong> Air is pumped through bellows to create pressure on the reeds.</li>
            <li><strong>Keyboard:</strong> Similar to a piano, keys activate the reeds.</li>
            <li><strong>Registers:</strong> Multiple sets of reeds to offer different tonal qualities.</li>
            <li><strong>Drones:</strong> Sustained notes to create a rich, full sound.</li>
            <li><strong>Scale Changer:</strong> Allows changing the musical key.</li>

    <center><h1>Important Notes</h1></center>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Swar</h2>
        <p>Swar is nothing but a musical note. There are seven Standard Notes in Indian Classical Music as given below.<br> We call these notes as "Shuddha Swar". Shuddha Swar: Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni. They are also called Shadja, Rishabh, Gandhar, Madhyam, Pancham, Dhaivat and Nishad respectively.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="section">
        <h2>Sangeet</h2>
        <p>In the context of Indian classical music, "sangeet" (संगीत) translates to "music" or "the art of music". It encompasses vocal music, instrumental music, and dance, all of which are considered complementary aspects of "sangeet". The term itself means "singing in a correct way,".In essence, "sangeet" is the broader concept of music, while the harmonium is a specific instrument used to create and accompany "sangeet," particularly in the context of Indian classical music. </p>
    </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Naad</h2>
            <p>A meaningful and musical sound is called Naad.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Dhwani</h2>
            <p>The vibrations that are heard through the ears and are created by the movement of objects are called sound.</p>
    </div>
         <div class="section">
            <h2>Achal Swar</h2>
            <p>The swaras which are always suddh, never be a Komal or Tivra are called Achal swar. Achal swaras are the notes Shadja and Pancham. These notes are constant/fixed on the scale. Achal means immovable.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Chal or Vikrut Swar</h2>
            <p>A note that rises or falls from its original pitch — that is, it changes its frequency — is called a Chal (movable) or Vikrut (altered) note.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>komal Swar</h2>
            <p>Komal (soft or flat) notes are those which are lower in pitch than their original (natural) position. There are four Komal Swars: Re, Ga, Dha, and Ni.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Teevra Swar</h2>
            <p>Teevra (sharp) notes are those which are higher in pitch than their original (natural) position. Only one note, Ma (Madhyam), is a Teevra Swar.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Varjit Swar or Vivadi Swar</h2>
            <p>The notes that are not used in a raga are called Varjit Swar (forbidden notes) or Vivadi Swar (dissonant notes).</p>  
    </div>
         <div class="section">
            <h2>Saptak</h2>
            <p>In Indian classical music, the series of seven notes from Sa to Ni, repeated in a cycle, is called a Saptak (octave).</p>
    </div>
         <div class="section">
            <h2>The three main Saptaks</h2>
            <p>
The primary three octaves are:

Mandra Saptak – Lower octave

Madhya Saptak – Middle octave

Taar Saptak – Higher octave</p>
    </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Mel or Thaat</h2>
            <p>A Thaat is a systematic arrangement of seven notes that has the potential to create various ragas. In Hindustani classical music, there are 10 recognized Thaats. In Karnatak (South Indian) music, there are 72 Melas (parent scales), which were demonstrated and established by Pandit Venkatamakhi.</p>

            <h2>Pakad (Catch Phrase) of a Raga</h2>
            <p>To clearly express the identity of a raga, a small group of notes is sung repeatedly during its performance. This characteristic group of notes is called the Pakad (catch phrase) of the raga.</p>    
    </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Alaap</h2>
            <p>In raga singing, when the artist begins to elaborate and expand the notes slowly and thoughtfully, it is called an Alaap.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Taan</h2>
            <p>In raga singing, when the notes are elaborated at a fast pace, it is called a Taan.
Unlike Alaap, Taan involves the use of notes with vowel sounds like “akar”, “aakar”, and “ikar”.
This technique is performed with speed and clarity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Lakshan Geet</h2>
      <p>The characteristics (Lakshan) of a Raga include its Vadi (most prominent note), Samvadi (second most prominent note), the Swaras (notes) used, its Thaat (parent scale), the Varjit Swaras (forbidden notes), the time of performance (Gaan Samay), its movements like Aroha (ascent), Avaroha (descent), Pakad (signature phrase), and other such identifying features. A composition or description that explains all these aspects is known as the Lakshan Geet (characteristic song of the Raga).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Swarmaalika/Sargamgeet</h2>
      <p>A melodic composition made up of the notes used in a raga is called a Swarmaalika. It is also referred to as Sargamgeet or Suravarta.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Sthayi</h2>
      <p>The initial glimpse or introduction of a song, sung in a steady (madhya or mand) tempo, is called the Sthayi.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Antara</h2>
      <p>The Antara is the part of a song that follows the Sthayi. It serves as the next or higher section of the composition and often explores higher notes compared to the Sthayi.</p> 
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Alankaar</h2>
      <p>A special ascending and descending arrangement of notes is called an Alankaar or sometimes Palta. These are decorative patterns of swaras used for practice and ornamentation in music.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Aaroha</h2>
      <p>The ascending order or sequence in which the notes (swaras) are arranged is called Aaroha.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Avaroha</h2>
      <p>The descending sequence or order in which the notes (swaras) are arranged is called Avaroha.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Raag</h2>
      <p>A Raag is a structured and rule-based arrangement of specific notes (swaras) that is designed to delight the mind and evoke emotions. A Raag is systematically formed with defined elements such as:</p>
<ul><li>Thaat (parent scale)</li>
<li>Jati (number of notes used)</li>
<li>Vadi (most important note)</li>
<li>Samvadi (second most important note)</li>
<li>Swaras (notes used)</li>
<li>Prahar (time of performance)</li>
<li>Aaroha (ascending order)</li>
<li>Avaroha (descending order), etc.</li>
</ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Raga Jati</h2>
      <p>Raga Jati refers to the classification of a raga based on the number of swaras (notes) used in its Aaroha (ascending) and Avaroha (descending) patterns. The raga is identified by how many and which notes are used in these movements.

There are five main types of Jati based on swara usage:</p>
<ol><li>Audav (Odav) – 5 notes</li>

<li>Shadav – 6 notes</li>

<li>Sampurna – 7 notes</li></ol>
<p>By combining these, a raga can be of types like:</p>
<ul><li>Sampurna–Audav</li>
<li>Shadav–Audav</li>
<li>Shadav–Sampurna</li>
<li>Audav-Sampurna</li>
<li>Audav-Shadav</li>
<li>Sampurna-Shadav</li>
</ul>
<p>This classification helps in understanding the structure and feel of a raga.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Vadi Svar</h2>
      <p>The Vadi Svar is the most prominent or dominant note in a raga. It holds special importance and is used frequently and with emphasis during the raga's performance. This note often defines the character of the raga and plays a key role in expressing its mood.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Samvadi Svar</h2>
      <p>The Samvadi Svar is the second most important note in a raga, after the Vadi Svar. It usually complements the Vadi and is often located a fourth or fifth interval away from it. The Samvadi helps enhance the raga's expression and emotional depth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Anuvadi Swar</h2>
      <p>Anuvadi Swar are the other permitted notes in a raga besides the Vadi and Samvadi. These notes are neither emphasized like Vadi or Samvadi, nor forbidden. They are used in the raga but without special stress, helping to complete the melodic framework naturally.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Bhajan</h2>
      <p>A Bhajan is a form of devotional poetry or song composed by saints and spiritual figures to guide human life toward happiness, prosperity, and spiritual well-being. It promotes devotion to God, reverence for nature, and the teachings of divine beings. Bhajans are expressions of faith, moral values, and inner peace.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
    <h2>Tarana</h2>
    <p>A Tarana is a rhythmic and melodious composition made up of meaningless syllables or sound-based words. These syllables, such as "joom," "toom," "tan," "danan," "derena," etc., do not carry any literal meaning but are used for their musical and rhythmic effect. Tarana showcases a singer’s skill in speed, rhythm, and melody, and is often performed in fast tempo.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Taal</h2>
    <p>Taal is the rhythmic framework in music that helps maintain a sense of timing and balance in a composition. It refers to a structured cycle of beats (matras) that governs the rhythm of a song. The division of beats and their consistent repetition bring discipline and measurement to the music.
In short, Taal is the unit of time measurement in Indian classical music, providing a rhythmic foundation for both melody and performance.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Maatra</h2>
    <p>A Maatra is the basic unit of time or beat used to measure rhythm in a Taal. It is like a single count or pulse in the rhythmic cycle. Just as seconds measure time, Maatras measure the timing in music.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Laya</h2>
    <p>Laya refers to the speed or tempo of a Taal—the consistent flow of time in music. It determines how fast or slow a composition is performed.

There are three main types of Laya:</p>
      <ol><li>Vilambit Laya – Slow tempo</li>
        <li>Madhya Laya – Medium tempo</li>
        <li>Drut Laya – Fast tempo</li></ol>
        <p>In simple terms, Laya is the measured pace at which a musical piece is performed within a rhythmic cycle.</p>
